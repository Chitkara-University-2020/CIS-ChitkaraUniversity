DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT-
Our team created a prototype for  patient-centred information exchange system.
The system is designed to give patients and their healthcare providers secure access to health information.
Patients can electronically access all their health treatments and their details using monitored dashboards provided by the hospital.Â 
In order to demonstrate this,we created a small website for a particular hospital at a particular
location to manage the communication of the patients of that hospital to the doctors.In this website
you need to make an account and after login it will ask patient about his disease or problem and
accordingly make an appointment which the patient can see in his dashboard. In Dashboard all 
the information regarding the patient will be saved or uploaded by the hospital staff. We will
give the right to the authority of hospital staff for editing and uploading the information. Except
hospital staff nobody can edit the information. By doing so, the patients will not only get all the information about their appointment but it(website) will also decrease the rate of spreading infections
due to any virus in future.Moreover with this solution the hospital staff can also prescribed medicines to their patients if they will suffering from minor infection or fever.
