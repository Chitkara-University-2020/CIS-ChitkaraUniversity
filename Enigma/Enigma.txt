Description of our project. [KnackHub]

1) Idea brief : 

It makes education easy, interesting and rewarding at the same time.
We often see that students share their notes and innovative tricks with their friends and 
known people without any second thought. So, we thought of creating a platform where learners can 
share their work to a wider audience and can get rewarded for their hard work.
This will encourage students to work hard and their notes and ideas will reach a wider audience 
who can use them fir their betterment.

2) What positive and unique solutions your idea have? :

Users can upload even a single image, video or pdf and can be rewarded for it.
Users can search though specific topics through search bar and bookmark the posts which they like for further use.
There is an open chat where users can ask or answer questions.
Every post has comment and report option.
Easy to use and attractive UI with one tap sign in option will attract more and more learners.
The app is completely free for users.
All these things will help the people who want to learn something and will reward people who even
 have a single idea or self made notes, who, without this app would have just shared them for free.
