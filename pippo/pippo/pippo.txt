#################### Description ######################

In this Hospital management system any hospital can register and they will get a website of their hospital data of which like departments
of their hospital, data of doctors, data of patients they are having, their tagline and much more they can edit according to their needs. 
Patients can search for the hospital from whose doctor they want an appointment and can select the symptoms they are suffering from. Those
symptoms can be added Or removed accordingly by the hospital itself as the access has been given to them. 
Doctors of particular hospital are having their accounts over the site of hospital so that they can check their appointment requests thier
profile they can edit. 
In a nutshell our system trying to provide a service with which the data of all the hospitals can be managed and patients are able to get 
appointment from whichever hospital they want and contact the doctor of any department without physically being present their.

################## OUR IDEA ##########################

 > Our idea aims to provide easy virtual access to patients to all the hospitals present in India. Using our web application, patients can 
   book appointments according to time slots available and get medical records virtually, to which they can access anytime,anywhere in the 
   world by just logging into their account,this eliminates the need of carrying and managing physical copies of reports and prescriptions.
   Moreover,this also reduces the effort to physically going to the hospital and waiting in long queues for your turn.
   Our idea manages and saves time and efforts of the people in the medical industry.

 > Our idea is unique as their is no existing system in implementation that takes the current exhaustive system of managing data of 
   patients and booking appointments completely online. The thing that makes our idea more unique is that we provide one portal that gives
   access to all hospitals so that with patient's consent, their personal data can be shared between hospitals with a click of a button 
   eliminating the need of exchanging physical reports and prescriptions by 100%.
